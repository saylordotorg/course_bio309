Zoology is the scientific study of diversity of animal life,
classification, physiology, behavior, and evolution. Unicellular
organisms have evolved into complex multicellular forms. Organisms, both
unicellular and multicellular, in various complex shapes and sizes are
found in almost every habitat and environment. The field of zoology
includes many subfields of biology as well as a vast diversity of
unicellular and multicellular organisms. Animals first appeared in the
fossil record an estimated 600 million years ago as multicellular
protozoa. Over the next 70 million years, they radiated into an
incredible number of different invertebrate phyla (which represent the
majority of animal groups and species), and in the next 150 million
years, vertebrate and invertebrate species began to colonize the land.
Though the history of animals is extensive and the fossil record at
times is conflicted and vague, understanding the historical connections
between animals is important in order to understand modern-day
relationships among animals and the adaptations that are characteristic
of specific groups. In this course, you will gain a broad understanding
of zoology. The course will begin with an introduction to and definition
of zoology, invertebrate phyla, and vertebrate phyla. You will then
study the history and evolution of animals. This course will also cover
taxonomy, focusing on classical and modern means of classification and
providing a broad survey of animal phyla, including some of their shared
features and unique characteristics. It will also introduce you to the
comparative anatomy and physiology of animals. Finally, the course will
address animal ecology: the interaction of animals with one another and
with their environment. This course will prepare you for further study
in any biological field that involves animals, including ecology,
wildlife management, evolution, animal physiology, animal behavior, and
even human biology

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   have a comprehensive knowledge of zoology and its relationship with
    other fields of biology;
-   compare and contrast anatomical and physiological characteristics of
    vertebrates and invertebrates;
-   answer specific questions about zoogeography, geologic time scale,
    animal evolution, and paleontology;
-   define, identify, and describe the different body systems; and
-   apply this knowledge for further study in any biological fields that
    involves animals.

### Course Information

Welcome to BIO309. Below, please find some general information on the
course and its requirements.

**Course Designer:** Olivia D'Ambrogio

**Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   EstrellaMountain Community College: Dr.  Michael Farabee’s *[Online
    Biology
    Book](http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/BioBookTOC.html)*
-   Dr. John Kimball’s [Biology
    Pages](http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/W/Welcome.html)
-   Universityof Michigan’s [Animal Diversity
    Web](http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/index.html)
-   University of California, Berkeley’s [Museum of
    Paleontology](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/index.php)

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Unit 1, as this introductory unit will lay the
groundwork for understanding the more advanced, exploratory material
presented in the latter units. You will also need to complete:

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the readings, video lectures, and other resources in
the course.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **74.5
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 10 hours. Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total
of 8 hours) over the course of a week: read a third of the introductory
readings for subunit 1.1 (about 2 hours) on Monday night; a third of the
introductory readings for subunit 1.1 (about 2 hours) on Tuesday; the
remainder of the introductory readings for subunit 1.1 (about 2 hours)
on Wednesday night; the materials for subunit 1.1.3 (about a total of 2
hours) on Thursday night; etc.
