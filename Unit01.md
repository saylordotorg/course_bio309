**Unit 1: Introduction to Zoology** <span id="1"></span> 
*What is zoology? How does it fit into the large field of biology? In
this unit, we will work to answer these questions. The unit will also
review the anatomy of animal cells and how they are unique.*

Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   recognize a few major figures in the development of the field of
    zoology;
-   identify the fundamentals of animal-dispersal patterns;
-   list different time scales, identify fossil types, and explain the
    ways in which a study of these time scales and fossils illuminates
    our understanding of evolution; and
-   distinguish between plants and animals in terms of their cellular
    differences and similarities.

     Instructions: Read these lecture notes for a general overview of
    biogeography. Cross-disciplinary sciences have attracted a lot of
    attention and support in recent years through a convergence of
    academic perspectives that provide us with a fuller understanding of
    our interconnected and interdependent world. In this section, we
    will learn about two prominent cross-disciplinary fields that rely
    on a zoological analysis of the Earth’s history, beginning with
    zoogeography and then moving on to paleozoology. In zoogeography, we
    study patterns of the past, present, and future geographical
    distribution of animals in nature and the processes that regulate
    these distributions. In other words, its the scientific analysis of
    the spatial and termporal patterns of biodiversity.

    excavations.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Look over this figure of an animal cell to understand
    its structure and organelles. You may choose to click on the links
    to each organelle to refresh your memory about their functions (but
    doing so is optional). When you look at an organism, how do you know
    whether it is an “animal” and not a fungus or protist or plant?
    Although this may seem simple, some organisms, like sponges and
    bryozoans, are not at all easy to classify as animals based on their
    looks alone. According to scientists, the only way to conclusively
    determine whether an organism is an animal is to confirm the absence
    of a cell wall. (Animal cells are enclosed by a flexible cell
    membrane rather than a cell wall).
