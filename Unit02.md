**Unit 2: Evolution and Taxonomy** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will survey the history and evolution of animals on
earth, with an eye toward understanding how certain adaptations led to
the animal kingdom’s success. We will also learn how animals are
classified and work towards a general understanding of biodiversity
among animals by learning the major characteristics of representative
animal phyla.* ***Evolution*** *refers to the process by which forms of
life have changed through time by what is described as* *descent with
modification*. *Taxonomy is the* *science of naming and classifying
living things. Taxonomy and* *evolutionare* *related, because the system
of* *taxonomyis based on evolutionary and genetic differences.*

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   identify major eras and basic taxonomy, and explain the significance
    of the Cambrian Explosion in terms of animal diversity and species
    radiation;
-   identify acoelomates, pseudocoelomates, and coelomates when given
    examples from the phyla covered in the course;
-   compare and contrast the anatomy/evolution of the amnion, skulls,
    eyes, exoskeleton, and integument among different groups, with
    specific emphasis on the eye;
-   identify organisms within each phylum covered (including,
    occasionally, organisms within different classes or subclasses), and
    recognize some traits (anatomical and behavioral) specific to each
    group;
-   explain the ecological significance of various organisms within
    these phyla/groups;
-   use a cladorgam or phylogenetic tree to explain evolutionary
    relationships and recognize terms related to it (e.g. “monophyletic”
    and “paraphyletic”); and
-   explain and identify homologies and analogies.

    quite coelomates) possess a fluid filled cavity between the mesoderm

    endoderm, and mesoderm) are not clearly distinguished. The fluid
    filled cavity functions as a skeleton, somewhat supporting the body
    shape.

    attention to any diagrams and images. Protostomes are a group of
    animals in which the mouth develops first. Protostomes also possess
    a true body cavity–the coelom. molluscs, annelids, and arthropods
    fall under this category.

    outlined in subunits 2.5.1-2.5.3. Deuterostomes are distinguished
    from protostomes by the fact that the first opening of the body
    cavity–the blastopore–becomes the anus. The mouth develops opposite
    to the blastopore, or the anus. The digestive tract then develops
    connecting the mouth and anus. The coelom of these organisms also
    develops internally. Echinodermata, Hemichordata, and Chordata
    belong to Deuterostomes*. *You will learn about each of these more
    in-depth in subunits 2.6.1-2.6.3.

    Craniata (the vertebrates) consists of all animals that have a skull
    encasing a brain. These animals have central nervous systems,
    brains, spinal cords, and endoskeletons. We will study this order,
    because you are likely to encounter its members (birds, snakes,
    squirrels, fish—and humans) in your day-to-day life.
