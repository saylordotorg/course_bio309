**Unit 3: Comparative and Anatomy and Physiology** <span id="3"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to the basics of animal anatomy and
physiology. The unit will focus primarily on those characteristics and
systems that are shared among animal groups but will also provide you
with an overview of some of the physiological differences among animal
groups and the evolutionary pressures that led to those differences.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
**Time Advisory:** This unit will take you 23 hours to complete.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

-   list and describe both general features of physiological systems and
    traits/adaptations specific to particular animal groups;
-   explain the physiological aspects of sensory apparatus (vision,
    olfaction, hearing, electromagnetic sensing, etc.), their ecological
    role(s), and their significance (e.g. their function in navigation,
    mating, and predation);
-   identify which kinds of receptors are found on which groups of
    organisms; 
-   identify which animal groups use which reproductive systems and
    describe the assumed advantages of each system; and
-   describe and identify physiological and associated behavioral
    changes that occurred during tetrapod evolution and, in particular,
    the evolution of terrestrial forms (including changes in skin,
    skeletal positioning, fertilization, and egg-laying).

    introduction to the topic. You should also read the entirety of the
    *Science Daily* article to get a sense of how non-vertebrate species
    deal with infections. The immune system is the body’s “defense
    mechanism.” The components of the immune system include cells and
    organs that protect the body from invasive bacteria and viruses.
    Adaptive and innate immunity are the two components of the immune
    system.

     Instructions: Read from the beginning of this page through the
    section “Vertebrates Have Paired Kidneys” as well as the section
    “Kidney Function.” This resource covers the topics outlined in
    subunits 3.9.1 and 3.9.2. The excretory system functions to remove
    toxic metabolic waste from the organism’s system to maintain
    homeostasis (equilibrium). Kidneys and skin eliminate urine and
    sweat as waste products. In this section, you will be reading about
    vertebrate and invertebrate excretory systems.
