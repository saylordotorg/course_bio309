**Unit 4: Animal Ecology** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this final unit, we will learn how animals fit into the global
ecology. Remember that ecology is the biological study of organisms’
interactions with their environments. The abundance and distribution of
animals depends on abiotic factors, such as climate and habitat, as well
as biotic factors, such as species’ interactions with other organisms.
In this unit you will learn about the factors affecting global animal
distributions, the interrelationships among organisms within
communities, and the relationship of animals to energy and carbon
cycles.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   distinguish between logistic and exponential growth and know when
    one type of growth would occur vs. the other (e.g. density-dependent
    vs. density-independent growth);
-   identify factors that influence carrying capacity and show that they
    understand that the carrying capacity for a single population can
    change over time depending on the presence/abundance of resources;
-   identify the point of maximum sustainable yield within a population
    based on its size and growth rate;
-   describe and identify the differences between K- and r-selected
    species;
-   identify the type of migration behavior that would occur under given
    conditions;
-   explain and describe the effects that competition and predation have
    on populations’ sizes, distribution, and niches;
-   discuss the complexity of most food webs, including the
    disproportionate effects that some species can have on them (e.g.
    keystone species) and the reduction of assimilation efficiency up a
    food chain;
-   compare and contrast the relative levels of biodiversity in each
    biome and explain what traits of biomes cause these differences in
    biodiversity;
-   identify which reproductive isolating mechanism(s) would be
    operating under given circumstances; and
-   identify where carbon is sequestered within a system, how/where it
    is released, and its effect in the environment.
